# Plastic-Identification-Models
This code was done as part of my masters degree dissertation. 

It contains various scripts useful for developing YOLOv8, v11, and v12 object detection models.

If you are currently using a YOLO algorithm and need guidance on using YOLO algorithms or how to use the code here then email me at lewis.e.hall1@gmail.com
